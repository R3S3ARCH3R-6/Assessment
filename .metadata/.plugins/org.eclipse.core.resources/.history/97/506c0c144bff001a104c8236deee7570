	//not smart to write nested classes b/c it is difficult to test and manage (same with the classes below)
	//best time to use them is if there is an alg you don't want others to access or keep exclusive
	//knowledge for this is good, implementation is not smart
	
	//ex of how to access a public, nested class with an outside class
	public class Y{
		public void helloY(){
			System.out.println("Hello Y");

//we must have 1 public class, but we can have mult. default classes in here too
	//these classes will make a new .class file in the .bin folder
	//not best practice, esp. if the other classes have very different behaviors
