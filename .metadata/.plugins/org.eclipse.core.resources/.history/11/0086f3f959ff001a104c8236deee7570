		 * 2) If there is no relationship of if the child object is not created and you 
		 *  try to convert your parent object to Child class, it will throw unchecked ClassCastException
		 *   -(happens when we have no __ )
		 * Relationship also means it cannot be siblings
		 * - class having mult children (can only convert obj b/w parent and child, not b/w the children)
		 * - siblings cannot be converted into each other
		 * we can also convert b/w a grandparent and grandchild
		 * 3) Conversion b/w siblings is not possible
		 * 
		 * Types of Casting
		 * 1) Implicit Casting (Done by compiler)
